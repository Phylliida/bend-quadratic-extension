# bend-quadratic-extension

Formally verified quadratic extension library in [Bend](https://github.com/bendlang/bend) (Bend 2).

Spike status: exact integer arithmetic (`Int`, a `(pos, neg)` difference pair)
with the full ring law set proved — `add_comm`, `add_assoc`, `add_exchange`,
`add_zero`, `zero_add`, `neg_invol`, `neg_add`, `neg_mul`, `sub_eq_add_neg`,
`mul_comm`, `mul_assoc`, `mul_swap`, `mul_distrib`, `mul_add_left`,
`mul_zero`, `mul_one`, `one_mul`; a `Nat` lemma inventory (`add_comm`,
`add_assoc`, `add_exchange`, `mul_distrib`, `mul_assoc`, `mul_one`,
comparison-evidence bridges, the truncated-sub/ordering `ci*` family); and
`QExt` (elements `re + im*sqrt(d)`, radicand as an operation parameter) with
proved `add_comm` and `mul_comm`.

## Int is a presentation, not a canonical form

An `Int` is `Int{pos, neg}`, standing for `pos - neg`. Every operation is a
constructor built out of `Nat.add`/`Nat.mul`, so operations always compose and
every ring law above is a `Nat` semiring identity — no case analysis on sign
anywhere. The price is that `Int{1, 0}` and `Int{2, 1}` are both 1 and are
*not* `==`: `==` on `Int` does not decide equality. Deciding it is
`Int.canon`'s job, and it is needed only where a canonical representative
matters. The identities that name a specific representative of a value —
`x + (-x) = 0` above all — are therefore not `==` statements about `Int`, and
land with `Int.canon`.

The earlier sign-magnitude design (sign bit + magnitude, every op
canonicalizing through `Int.mk`) did have decidable `==`, but paid for it in
case analysis, and that case analysis is what the switch removed. See
`PROVING.md` for the measurement.

## Layout

Laws and proofs live in separate files; each `*_proofs.bend` fills every
law of its sibling via `def <alias>.<name>(...)`:

- `src/nat.bend` — the 79 Nat/Cmp laws, plus `Cmp.flip` (used in law
  statements). No proofs.
- `src/nat_proofs.bend` — fills every nat.bend law; also hosts the
  proof-only machinery (`CmpIsEQ`, `CmpIsGT`, `NatIsPos`, `Nat.pred`).
- `src/int.bend` — `Int` type, the ops (`Int.zero`, `Int.one`, `Int.add`,
  `Int.neg`, `Int.sub`, `Int.mul`), and the Int laws.
- `src/int_proofs.bend` — fills every int.bend law (Nat evidence via
  nat.bend, filled by the nat_proofs.bend import).
- `src/qext.bend` — `QExt` type, `QExt.nat`/`add`/`mul`, and the two laws.
- `src/qext_proofs.bend` — fills both qext.bend laws.
- `scratch.bend` — smoke test with a `main`.

Check with `node bend2/main.ts <file>` from a bend checkout. The three
`*_proofs.bend` files and `scratch.bend` are the gates and print
`All terms check.`; the laws-only files intentionally fail with
`Error: N TODOs found.` (an open law is an unfilled TODO). The count is
transitive over imports: nat.bend 79, int.bend 19 (it imports only `Base`),
qext.bend 21 = 19 Int + 2 QExt.

Known gaps, in dependency order: `Int.canon` with its quotient lemma
(`canon x == canon y` iff `xp + yn == yp + xn`) and `x + (-x) = 0` on top of
it; `Rat` (normalization needs gcd, which needs a division proof); binary
nats for performance (unary `Nat` is O(value)); then the field axioms and
ordering for `QExt`.
